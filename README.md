This is an environmental detection and control system based on arduino.Store data and analyze it with ThingSpeak. And set up email alerts about temperature and humidity changes from the previous day.

I use Arduino Uno WiFi Rev2,A0 is connected to the temperature sensor v1.3, A1 is connected to the soil moisture sensor, and A2 is the light sensor. I2C is the display (Grove-LCD RGB Backlight V4.0), D3 is the fan, D2 is the grove-buzzer, D4 is the servo, and D5 is the Led.
